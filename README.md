# GOL
**GOL** - _Game of Life_ - is a coding project for hands-on practice with programming logic, data structures, and algorithms. 

The project aims to build a functional version of John Conway's classic cellular automaton, a system that simulates the evolution of cells based on a set of simple rules.

## Project Goals
- Implement core logic: Develop the rules for a two-dimensional grid based on Conway's four rules.
- Visualize the simulation: Create a visual representation of the grid and its evolution over time.
- Explore different patterns: Experiment with famous initial patterns like the Glider, Lightweight Spaceship, and Gosper Glider Gun.
